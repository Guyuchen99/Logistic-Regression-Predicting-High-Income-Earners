# Logistic Regression: Predicting High-Income Earners

## Project Description

Income prediction is a significant area of study in economics and machine learning. It involved predicting an individual's income level based on various demographic and socioeconomic factors. This is crucial for policy-making, resource allocation and understanding economic disparities. 

**The main question I am answering is: Can an individual's age, years of education, occupation, sex, and hours per week be used as reliable predictors for determining whether their annual income will be greater than $50,000 in the United States?**

The dataset used for the study is the "Adult" dataset also known as the "Census Income" dataset. This dataset was donated on 4/30/1996 and extracted by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database. It has been preprocessed so that reasonably clean records are selected and is commonly used for classification tasks. It includes attributes such as  age, workclass, fnlwgt, education, education-num, marital status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, capital gain, capital loss, hours-per-week, and native country.
